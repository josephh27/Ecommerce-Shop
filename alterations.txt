- Fixed the filter function as using more than one filter will show all products.
- Fixed the synchronization of sorting and filter of products as it malfunctioning due to being in different components and states.
- Fixed some css responsiveness.
- Fixed pagination (specifically because it retains the last page number even when you filter some products that makes the number page exceed the limit)
- Fixed an UI error since it still shows the pagination even though there is no product found anymore.
