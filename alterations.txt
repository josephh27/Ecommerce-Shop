- Fixed the filter function as using more than one filter will show all products.
- Fixed some css responsiveness.
- Fixed pagination (specifically because it retains the last page number even when you filter some products that makes the number page exceed the limit)
- Fixed an UI error since it still shows the pagination even though there is no product found anymore.
